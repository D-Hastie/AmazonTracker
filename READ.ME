This is a work in progress. 
The main program will track items from a file using the Amazon Identification (ASIN) or other (ISBN, EAN, UPC) if specified within the BottleNose call. 
I have yet to produce a good method of call lookups from a list that use any of the ID methods.

The email checker is fairly new and least worked on part. It works by retrieving the latest CSV attachment in an email address, using GMail API. 
The bulk of the email code was found in a stack overflow answer https://stackoverflow.com/a/27556667/5772968.

The email checker varies from the tracker by using a found price and ID number and matching it to the current amazon listing.
